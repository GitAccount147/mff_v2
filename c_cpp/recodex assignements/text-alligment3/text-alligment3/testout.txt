Tut,  man, one fire burns
out   another's  burning,
One  pain  is lessen'd by
another's  anguish;  Turn
giddy,    and   be   holp
12345678901234567890123
by  backward turning; One
desperate   grief   cures
with  another's languish:
Take    thou   some   new
infection to thy eye, And
the  rank  poison  of the
old will die.
